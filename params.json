  "body": "### About ProgressScreen\r\nThis is a full screen application that uses a web view to display information to the user. This is intended to show information to the end user during builds using JAMF’s Casper, though you may find other uses for it. This application was inspired by IBM’s build process shown at JAMFs user conference in 2015.\r\n\r\nThe web view can either be embedded or set via scripting. Embedding the HTML will require you to recompile the application.\r\n\r\nThe application monitors the jamf.log and in conjunction with optional waypoints an estimated time displays a progessbar to the user. When the last package is installed, the application quits. The user can quit the screen any time with Command-Q.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use Case\r\nProgressScreen is typically most useful in DEP and user enrollment scenarios.  This application does not generally work well in a imaging workflow.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nCreate and Set your own HTML Content. Pages can continually be changed via scripting if desired.\r\nSet the estimated build time, this will allow the progress bar to display a more accurate estimated completion time.\r\nUpdate the progess bar by editing currentTime via scripting along side an optional waypoint method.\r\nNEW! Applescript / JavaScript Support!\r\n\r\nYou can now setup ProgressScreen through scripting, no more coding needed.\r\n\r\nCheck out the Wiki for more information.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nSet HTML Content:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntell application \"ProgressScreen\"\r\nset htmlURL of every configuration to \"/Users/username/Documents/TestHTML/index.html\"\r\nend tell\r\nSet Progress Bar Total Time: (in seconds)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ntell application \"ProgressScreen\"\r\nset buildTime of every configuration to 2000\r\nend tell \r\nSet the current progress time: (in Seconds)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ntell application \"ProgressScreen\"\r\nset currentTime of every configuration to 1000\r\nend tell \r\nConfigure FullScreen Mode: (FullScreen default)\r\n```\r\n```\r\ntell application \"ProgressScreen\"\r\nset fullscreen of every configuration to true\r\nend tell\r\nShow / Hide the Quit Button on the Screen: (Shows by default)\r\n```\r\n```\r\ntell application \"ProgressScreen\"\r\n    set hideQuitButton of every configuration to true\r\nend tell\r\n```\r\n\r\nWaypoints: You can enable the waypoint method to help position the progress bar display a more accurate completion time. You MUST know the order in which your packages will be delivered for this to work. There are four waypoints which will adjust the progress bar in the following order: 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, and completion.\r\n\r\nExample Script:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntell application \"ProgressScreen\"\r\n    set useWayPointMethod of every configuration to true\r\n    set wayPointOne of every configuration to \"Chrome.pkg\"\r\n    set wayPointTwo of every configuration to \"FireFox.pkg\"\r\n    set wayPointThree of every configuration to \"Office.pkg\"\r\n    set wayPointFour of every configuration to \"CyberDuck.pkg\"\r\nend tell\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
